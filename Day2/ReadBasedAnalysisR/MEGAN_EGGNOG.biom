Also binds fibronectin and chains B- beta and gamma of fibrinogen, promoting clumping of S.aureus with fibrinogen. Was also shown to adhere to plastic (By similarity). Inactivation of isdA leads to a decrease both in the amount of heme-iron associated with S.aureus cells and the amount of heme- iron that enters the staphylococcal cytoplasm. This suggests that IsdA could play a role in the removal of heme from hemoglobin. It was also demonstrated that the IsdA-mediated iron-acquisition system from transferrin could play only an ancillary role in the iron uptake whereas the siderophore-mediated iron-acquisition system from transferrin seems to play an essential or dominant role. Overexpression of isdA enhances S.aureus growth and an isdA inactivation mutant shows a growth defect when grown in liquid medium containing heme as the sole iron source which suggests that IsdA may function as a cell surface reservoir for heme.
