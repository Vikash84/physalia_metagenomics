The reaction is reversible (By similarity). Binds transferrin, lactoferrin, heme, hemoglobin, hemin, fetuin, asialofetuin and protein A. Also binds fibronectin and chains B- beta and gamma of fibrinogen, promoting clumping of S.aureus with fibrinogen. Was also shown to adhere to plastic (By similarity). Inactivation of isdA leads to a decrease both in the amount of heme-iron associated with S.aureus cells and the amount of heme- iron that enters the staphylococcal cytoplasm. This suggests that IsdA could play a role in the removal of heme from hemoglobin. It was also demonstrated that the IsdA-mediated iron-acquisition system from transferrin could play only an ancillary role in the iron uptake whereas the siderophore-mediated iron-acquisition system from transferrin seems to play an essential or dominant role. Overexpression of isdA enhances S.aureus growth and an isdA inactivation mutant shows a growth defect when grown in liquid medium containing heme as the sole iron source which suggests that IsdA may function as a cell surface reservoir for heme. Involved in adherence of S.aureus to human desquamated nasal epithelial cells and is required for nasal colonization. Protects S.aureus against the bactericidal protease activity of apolactoferrin in vitro and confers resistance to bovine lactoferricin.
