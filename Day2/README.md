## Read-based analyses

First let's re-open the "screen" from yesterday and see if our script has finished running.

- Connect to the server
- Re-open the "screen" from yesterday

```bash
screen -r read_based
```

Is the script still running? How can you tell?  
If the script hasn't finished yet:
- Stop it by pressing **Ctrl+c**
- Copy the results from the course main folder to your folder:

```bash
cp -r ../MEGAN .
cp -r ../METAXA .
```

- At this point we can close the screen permanently by typping **exit**.
